# 1. Background

GPS (Global Positioning System) is widely used in outdoor environment for determing the location. However, it is not a suitable solution of indoor localization, because the wall attenuates the GPS signal from satellites. Therefore, we consider two RF technologies: ANT and BLE. 

The table compare the propaties of those two RF techlonodgies
